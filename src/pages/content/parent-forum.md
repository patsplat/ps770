Every Friday, Ms. Saratovsky, the principal holds a parent forum called, "Breakfast with Ms. Saratovsky."  Parents and Ms. Saratovsky come together  to discuss schoolwide initiatives, parenting concerns and tips, and a book study/workshop using: "How to Talk so Kids Will Listen, and How to Listen so Kids Will Talk" by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish and Parenting with Love and Logic.  This is a unique opportunity for parents to come together and build a supportive community for each other.
