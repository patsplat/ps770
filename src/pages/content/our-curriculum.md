description: >-
  Our curriculum consists of Common Core aligned instruction in literacy, math,
  science, and social studies. Our unique structure of looping and weekly 
  planning periods, allow for teacher teams to make constant adjustments to the
  curriculum based on student needs.  The embedded Master Teacher mentors the
  teachers on a daily basis to ensure effective and rigorous instruction. The
  Master Teacher also supports the students by providing push-in or pull-out one
  on one, or small group instruction.

**Interdisciplinary**

All of our students engage in inquiry based learning around 4 interdisciplinary units: communication, scientific inquiry, the engineering process, and social justice/community activism.  Every 6 weeks, the interdisciplinary unit culminates in a curriculum celebration where the students become the teachers, and the parents become the students.  The parents participate in experiments and activities around the unit.  We have had parents dissect frogs, build planes and boats, participate in museum walks, and make apple flavored play-doh.  Our final unit, communication, culminates in a school wide play through the theme of our HEART values.  



**Music/PE/Art**

All of our students are involved in fifty minutes of PE or Music daily.  The Pre-K students start their day with music and movement and grades K-5 have an exercise period throughout the day.  In addition to the daily exercise, our students also have thirty minutes of recess.  Many of our teachers are also certified in a NYC initiative called "Move to Improve" which brings daily fitness breaks into the classroom.   All research shows, that the more opportunities students have to move their bodies during the day, the more they can focus and engage in the learning.  Additionally, all of our students receive art for 90 minutes per week in 6 week cycles through Rush Arts.
