**\*AN INSIDE SCHOOL PICK!\***

PS 770, is an elementary school located in District 17 comprised of grades Pre-K through 5th grade.  We are located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. ﻿ Our mission statement is “to empower learners and inspire leaders to make this a better world.” ﻿ 

PS 770 operates using an open classroom concept with a team teaching approach.  Each grade is comprised of a cohort of 50-60 students who loop together with their teachers.  Each cohort is lead by a teaching team of 3 or 4 teachers, including an embedded Master Teacher who is charged with leading the team of adults and ensuring sound instructional practice for the students.  

Each team has 155 minutes of weekly collaborative time to vet lessons, analyze student data, meet with parents, discuss students, plan curriculum, and view recorded lessons using the lens of instructional rounds.  In addition to the weekly 155 minutes, each teacher team engages in 50 minutes of weekly reflective practice using a reflective protocol and 35 minutes of parent engagement time.  Every 6 weeks, the teams meet with a reflective practitioner to analyze themes and trends across the team and/or school to strengthen team dynamics and effectiveness.  

All new faculty members attend a 1 week summer training  to engage in learning around reflective listening and understand Myers-Briggs Personality Profiles. This allows teams to learn to communicate and collaborate more effectively and deepen the understanding of all team members.   

 We focus on a social/emotional initiative using Love and Logic and  RULER.
