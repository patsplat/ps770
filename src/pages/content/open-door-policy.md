Our parents/guardians come with a wide variety of skills and talents that we celebrate.   Parents come into the school and classrooms at any time.  No appointment needed.  On a daily basis, our PTA room is full of parents looking to volunteer in the cafeteria, classrooms, or maintain our new school garden.

Our parents started a  volunteer reading program on Wednesday mornings where they tutor students.  

Every six weeks, parents come to the classrooms to lead activities for the students ranging from photography, science experiments, planting and art projects.

At PS 770, we believe that parents are an extremely valuable part of our community and the relationships that we create are a true priority.
