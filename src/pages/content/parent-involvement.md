PS 770 prides itself on the relationships that it builds between teachers, students, and families.  

Our PTA holds monthly meetings where pizza and babysitting are provided, hold events every second Saturday at the school, and create various parent-led committees.

We value parents being involved in all aspects of our community ranging from writing grants, tutoring, and the role of class parent.
